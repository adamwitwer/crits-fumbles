### Fumbles

We have two types of fumbles, Smack Down and Questionable Arcana.

#### Smack Down

The first fumbles table is what we’ve been using in my current campaign and isn’t a fumble table at all. Instead, it’s the so-called “Smack Down Table or the ‘shit happens’ list,” which (as far as I can tell) can only be found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/pandabarbear/art/The-New-Smack-Down-Table-518745000). PandaBarBear (the user who posted the table) notes that it’s “based on Hack Masters Expanded smart ass smack down table,” which doesn’t exist (as far as I can tell).

[Issue 31 of “HackJournal”](https://kenzerco.com/product/hackjournal-31-pdf/?add-to-cart=4805) has a “Fumbles & Mishaps” table, which is more serious in nature and includes unfortunate fumble events like increased hypertension (!) and muscle pulls. It’s nothing at all like the table we’ve been using.

A more likely source of the “Smack Down Table” is found in [issue 128 of “Knights of the Dinner Table,”](https://kenzerco.com/product/knights-of-the-dinner-table-128/) which includes “The EXPANDED Smart Ass Smack Down Table” on page forty-one, created for DMs to dish out punishment to disruptive players:

> Guaranteed to make your players wet themselves in fright, or at least make you feel more like an evil over-lord punishing insubordinates.

The “Smack Down Table” from PandaBarBear uses some but not all of the same player punishments.

In any case, as I said, it’s not a fumble table at all. I've used it in the app because we’ve been using it in our game even before I joined, and it’s funny.

#### Questionable Arcana

This is an actual fumbles table, and it accounts for Weapon and Magic attacks. Taken from [Questionable Arcana](https://growupandgame.com/dungeons-and-dragons/questionable-arcana/dnd-5e-crit-confirmed-critical-hit-charts-and-fumble-charts/).
